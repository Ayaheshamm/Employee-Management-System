# Employee-Management-System
Program Summary
Name:
Employee Management System

Objective:
Automatically track employee attendance and manage salary based on punctuality.

How it works:

Employees drive to work using their cars
System checks if they arrive before 9:00 AM based on:
Departure time
Distance (20 km)
Car speed (60 km/h)
Available fuel
On time → Salary +10 L.E
Late → Salary -10 L.E
Also tracks employee health, mood, and daily activities
Example: Samy leaves at 8:00 AM with his Fiat 128 → arrives at 8:20 AM → gets rewarded!
